The Yunshu therapy house is a two-story building for Zen recuperation and therapy courses. In the foyer, multilayered indirect lighting guides guests into a quiet and warm Zen world. The tearoom in the reception area is designed with a relaxing and comfortable lighting environment with minimized luminaire quantity. The meditation room is completely enclosed without any natural light. Consequently, a DMX-controlled RGBW lighting system sets up an immersive tranquil and gentle atmosphere. As requested by the therapists, the system enables them to guide meditation in a changing lighting environment, from soft white to dark warm red to bright white light.  The sound therapy room is on the basement floor. Natural light from the lightwell is integrated with indirect artificial light to create a variety of lighting modes based on the needs of the sound therapy course. With a pyramidal ceiling, the spacious yoga room hosts many group yoga activities. An artificial skylight illuminates the surroundings of the ceiling and diffuses circadian lighting to the whole yoga room.
