        "description": "Suzhou Wang Xiaohui Art Museum is a four-door old Jiangnan house. It is the Suzhou government that provides “Ding Zhai” to Wang Xiaohui free of charge as an art gallery open to the public. This is an art gallery that promotes contemporary works by Wang Xiaohui and famous artists from home and abroad.\n\nThe façade of the building is decorated with stainless steel curtains. During the day, the lines of the building are tough and rigorous. At night, the red facade of the old house in Jiangnan is restored against the light. The Dingzhai building has a deep sense of depth, and the interior and the courtyard form a layered effect. As the main empty space, the exhibition hall takes into account the combination of classical architecture and Wang’s contemporary art, and strives to realize the use of ancient houses. The exhibition hall space uses 0.9m**0.9m light boxes to distribute the entire ceiling. The RGBW lights in the light box are controlled by DMX512. The system realizes dynamic changes, which can not only meet the basic needs of the exhibition halls with bright and uniform space, but also present the works of Wang Xiaohui in a freehand manner on the ceiling; the courtyard has a strong “Suzhou classical garden” feature, in the lighting Adhering to the “quiet, quiet” principle of the garden.\n\nThe project opened in September 2013 and received much attention from the media, the art world and the lighting industry. In 2015, it won the second prize in the Lighting Interior Design Award.",
