        "description": "Located in the birthplace of Confucius, Nishan, about 25 kilometers southeast of Qufu, China, the Confucian Palace was built to honor Confucius and his disciples, and to demonstrate Confucianism and related Chinese cultures.\n\nThe lighting design covers a 65,000 sqm interior space, composed of traditional halls, auditoriums and amenities. Five functional halls are named after the Five Virtues of Confucianism: the halls of Benevolence, Righteousness, Courtesy, Wisdom and Loyalty. The ancient Chinese-style architectural structures, such as columns, Tou-kung and beams are extensively adopted in the Palace.\n\nThe challenge of lighting design is not only to provide various lighting scenes to fulfill multiple functions of each space, but also to highlight Confucius’ profound influence on Chinese people and culture through the interior design of the Palace. The lighting seamlessly integrates with traditional Chinese-style architecture, while adds another unique impressive layer.   \n\nThousands of customized Chinese traditional LED candlesticks controlled by a DMX521 system flicker throughout the Palace and symbolize “The Light of Confucianism Shines Forever”. Dozens of LED candle pendants are used in the Hall of Benevolence to create the ambience of a traditional Chinese library. Together with a large media screen, each LED candle in the pendants and every LED lighted bookshelf can be synchronized to present a five-minute light show called “The Power of Benevolence”.  \n\nFour distinctive small halls of Righteousness, Courtesy, Wisdom and Loyalty represent four legendary beasts in Chinese culture. Lighting matches interior decoration to create four different color atmospheres for the four halls respectively.  \n\nTo comply with energy code, luminaires are equipped with >100lm/w LED modules, and most of them are managed by lighting control systems with energy-saving mode. Meanwhile, customized and concealed luminaries are requested to use replaceable LED modules for both initial and maintenance cost considerations",

The Wuxi municipal government planned to maintain the original architectural framework and transform it into a commercial complex for indoor film studios and digital post-production. A film-themed park was developed through renovating the building’s facades, interior design, as well as restructuring the landscape.\n\nThe project was planned and designed by GENSLER Company. ATL consulted on the lighting design for covering the building facades, landscape and indoor facilities. ATL integrated LED lighting and an outdoor display facing the main street to highlight a color banner nearly 2 meters high and 1,000 meters long. For the indoor lighting, ATL provided the design for a large workshop, the public shopping mall, and various artworks.\n\nFollowing the completion of this project, Huallywood has become a prominent center for entertainment in Wuxi city.",

The projection lamps illuminating the roof were customized LED fixtures in the shape of the glazed tiles. The fixtures illuminate the tile surface, while the colour-changeable lights at the top are diffusely reflected. The floodlight of the main tower is a 2700K warm color light.\n\nIn consultation with interior designers, ATL created a warm and comfortable space with warm white light of 3000K. 2700K decorative LED lighting strips were used throughout for contrast.  \n\nIn Weihai, Huancui Tower is a beautiful lookout location.

ATL consultants considered two main aspects for the lighting design of Zen landscape, one was to meet the functional lighting for the tourist space, the other was to provide a phenomenal effect for Buddhist rituals and performances. ATL consultants developed a solution, a combination of artificial and natural lighting, a changeable divine sky on the top of the hall. It is a daylighting dome, to provide natural sunshine in sunny days, and meanwhile, energy-saving and long lifetime LED high-power spotlights are used to provide comfortable and safe basic lighting for the space under gloomy days and evening. During performance time, dome luminous film can simulate the morning and dusk in a short time to restore the sky at different times. The LED can change color and color temperature, showing a fresh and bright morning, or to simulate the blue sky and white clouds at noon. In Buddhist ritual moments, it can simulate the scene of Buddha Star Nirvana as well.\n\nDALI control technology is used in the solution, which guarantees the stability of lighting fixtures in large space. It enhances lifetime, implements the monitoring of the operation status and reduces the maintenance cost.
