        "description": "Located in the birthplace of Confucius, Nishan, about 25 kilometers southeast of Qufu, China, the Confucian Palace was built to honor Confucius and his disciples, and to demonstrate Confucianism and related Chinese cultures.\n\nThe lighting design covers a 65,000 sqm interior space, composed of traditional halls, auditoriums and amenities. Five functional halls are named after the Five Virtues of Confucianism: the halls of Benevolence, Righteousness, Courtesy, Wisdom and Loyalty. The ancient Chinese-style architectural structures, such as columns, Tou-kung and beams are extensively adopted in the Palace.\n\nThe challenge of lighting design is not only to provide various lighting scenes to fulfill multiple functions of each space, but also to highlight Confucius’ profound influence on Chinese people and culture through the interior design of the Palace. The lighting seamlessly integrates with traditional Chinese-style architecture, while adds another unique impressive layer.   \n\nThousands of customized Chinese traditional LED candlesticks controlled by a DMX521 system flicker throughout the Palace and symbolize “The Light of Confucianism Shines Forever”. Dozens of LED candle pendants are used in the Hall of Benevolence to create the ambience of a traditional Chinese library. Together with a large media screen, each LED candle in the pendants and every LED lighted bookshelf can be synchronized to present a five-minute light show called “The Power of Benevolence”.  \n\nFour distinctive small halls of Righteousness, Courtesy, Wisdom and Loyalty represent four legendary beasts in Chinese culture. Lighting matches interior decoration to create four different color atmospheres for the four halls respectively.  \n\nTo comply with energy code, luminaires are equipped with >100lm/w LED modules, and most of them are managed by lighting control systems with energy-saving mode. Meanwhile, customized and concealed luminaries are requested to use replaceable LED modules for both initial and maintenance cost considerations",

The fixtures illuminate the tile surface, while the colour-changeable lights at the top are diffusely reflected. The floodlight of the main tower is a 2700K warm color light.\n\nIn consultation with interior designers, ATL created a warm and comfortable space with warm white light of 3000K. 2700K decorative LED lighting strips were used throughout for contrast.  \n\nIn Weihai, Huancui Tower is a beautiful lookout location.

Meanwhile, the floodlights in the lower part of the top cover provide a basic safety illumination. The building facades and railings on the square are illuminated by accent lighting, creating a special atmosphere, and a holistic view for visitors in the distance.",

ATL consultants considered two main aspects for the lighting design of Zen landscape, one was to meet the functional lighting for the tourist space, the other was to provide a phenomenal effect for Buddhist rituals and performances. ATL consultants developed a solution, a combination of artificial and natural lighting, a changeable divine sky on the top of the hall. It is a daylighting dome, to provide natural sunshine in sunny days, and meanwhile, energy-saving and long lifetime LED high-power spotlights are used to provide comfortable and safe basic lighting for the space under gloomy days and evening. During performance time, dome luminous film can simulate the morning and dusk in a short time to restore the sky at different times. The LED can change color and color temperature, showing a fresh and bright morning, or to simulate the blue sky and white clouds at noon. In Buddhist ritual moments, it can simulate the scene of Buddha Star Nirvana as well.\n\nDALI control technology is used in the solution, which guarantees the stability of lighting fixtures in large space. It enhances lifetime, implements the monitoring of the operation status and reduces the maintenance cost. The lighting management system combines centralized master control with scene and timing control. It is integrated with stage and sound management system to create a real “Human Landscape”.",

A dynamic illumination system was specially designed for the reception area. The light color temperature is easily changed from 2700K to 5600K to create an environment that adapted to the rhythm of the human biological clock, changing slowly throughout the day.\n\nThe lighting control system in the meeting room space could also control the curtains to set the scene for conference discussions or for presentations with projections.
