As the largest contemporary Buddhist building in the world, the Guanyin Altar facilitates Buddhist cultural exhibition, sightseeing, pilgrimage, and international exchange in a 62,000 sqm space.

Combining modern architectural style, Buddhist and traditional Chinese culture, the unique architecture was reinforced by an innovative lighting design. By means of a lighting system integrating functional lighting and artistic lighting show, visitors are immersed in the spirit of Guanyin, “the light of Buddha shines on all living beings”.

To illustrate the culture of Guanyin, a variety of lighting techniques are used to precisely exhibit Buddhist art works and highlight traditional Chinese architectural elements.
